# AGRIBOT- An AI Chatbot

### About the project

As we all know, these days farmers face a lot of difficulties even after their harvest has been successful. After thorough research it was also found that the farmers
are also **unaware of the proper fertilizers to include in their crops and hence leading to increased investment for fertilizers**. Hence, our project aims to provide a crisp
solution for the farmer's difficulties encountered in the various phases like ***adding fertilizers to the soil, selling their crop efficiently and encouraging them to grow crops of 
certain varieties based on their locality to improve the overall yield***. *So here comes our project*!!!

The project uses basic human interactive language(a chatbot)to speak with the farmer. The chatbot uses API calls to extract data regarding the crop price, fertilizer 
details(in terms of rates and production)in a specific area in which the farmer wishes to grow his crop. The chatbot also has a built in recommendation system for both
***fertilizer recommendation and crop recommendation***.The crop recommendation is built using **Machine Learning models** to suggest recommendations on what type of crops 
are to be grown based on the state,soil ph value,rainfall,etc. so that a good yield could be observed.The project is built in a framework called *RASA* which enables building an interactive chatbot for the project using NLU
